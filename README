The canvas HTML element was invented by Apple. It was created to dynamically create complex images for Widgets. There where a few complains about the element, but despite of that it is included in the HTML 5.0 working draft. All modern browsers are compatible with the canvas-tag, beside of Internet Explorer, but Google created a superb piece of javascript that ported the canvas-tag to IE. I created a little piece of javascript for drawing multiple backgrounds in a canvas element behind an HTML element. 

The syntax

$mb(['id1','id2','id3'],
	['url(background1.png) no-repeat 8px top',
	'url(background2.png) no-repeat 8px bottom']);	
	
It should be pretty straight-forward.

Examples

Points of improvements

- It’s buggy (please report them)
- Maybe convert it into a class
- Speed (always a good one to improve)
- Destination element must have an absolute or relative position declared in his css
